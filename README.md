The course aims to provide students with the knowledge of object oriented programming and tools for its implementation in Python. Knowledge of the protocols for implementing web service oriented communication paradigms. Knowledge of the main tools for programming environment in real-time and in the presence of sensors and actuators. Tools for data analysis using machine learning.

The student will learn how to design a complete IoT system (microservice-based) and deploy it in a realistic application domain, starting data collection on IoT devices, data organization on the host, data processing, visualisation and user interaction
